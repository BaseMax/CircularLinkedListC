# Circular Linked-List C

This is a simple implementation of a circular linked-list in C. Circular linked-lists are a type of linked-list where the last node points to the first node. This is useful for implementing queues and stacks. This implementation is a doubly linked-list, meaning that each node has a pointer to the next node and a pointer to the previous node.
